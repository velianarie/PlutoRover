# PlutoRover

## Tools used:
* Visual Studio 2015
* NUnit 3
* Resharper (equality implementation is generated by Resharper)

## Code style:
* Using `var` keyword could be offensive to some people, I have some opinions about it, but not holding on those tightly. I'm only using it if the type is not directly obvious.
* I'm not using underscore prefix for private variable names because that's the standard in Cardano and I'm used to it now. I myself have no strong opinion about it, my motto is: use whatever style suits you, as long as it's consistent
* I don't usually use auto property even though Resharper suggested it as I would like to make it explicit (mostly to myself) that it is a property not a public field and whether it's a read-only or not 
* I don't use expression body, mostly because I can't get used to the syntax yet :)

## Changes I consider making
* Replace `Tuple<int, int>` with `Coordinate` class
* Replace `Rover(int x, int y, ...)` with this `Coordinate` class
* Pass in `Pluto` to `Rover` constructor
* `if else` statements in `Move()` strikes me as a bit of a code smell (see below my thoughts of how to possibly improve this)
* `Move()` function is too long, could be split into smaller chunks.

### My thoughts to improve Command Left & Right:
We could use some mathematical tricks like assigning integer number to the `Orientation` enum. Pick an orientation, assign integer value 1 then go clockwise and assign the next integer value, so something like: 
`East = 1, South = 2, West = 3, North = 4`.

Apply the following for `Left`:
<blockquote>
if (current orientation - 1) < 1, then get the previous orientation as if the enum is a circle
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
else (current orientation - 1)
</blockquote>

Example:
* current orientation: N ==> (4 - 1) = 3 (West)
* current orientation: S ==> (2 - 1) = 1 (East)
* current orientation: E ==> (1 - 1) = 0 (the previous orientation is North)
* current orientation: W ==> (3 - 1) = 2 (South)

Apply similar trick to `Right`, it is the opposite of Left after all:
<blockquote>
if (current orientation + 1) > 4, then get the next orientation as if the enum is a circle
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
else (current orientation + 1)
</blockquote>

Example:
* current orientation: N ==> (4 + 1) = 5 (the next orientation is East)
* current orientation: S ==> (2 + 1) = 3 (West)
* current orientation: E ==> (1 + 1) = 2 (South)
*	current orientation: W ==> (3 + 1) = 4 (North)

This trick would reduce the 8 `if else` statements to 2 functions.

Note however that I haven't thought about whether the two above pseudocodes would work for different enumeration value ie. if you start with `North = 1` for example.

For Command `Forward` & `Backward`, we can see the following pattern:
* Forward North = Backward South
* Foward South = Backward North
* Forward East = Backward West
* Forward West = Backward East

So perhaps we can reduce some of the `if else` statements based on these facts.
